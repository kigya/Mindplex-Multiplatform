## Development

### Setup

We use Git Hooks to run Detekt before commit so you need to install them:

```shell
./gradlew installGitHooks
```

## üìÅ Development Conventions

#### Branching

* **`master`**: The main branch where all changes are merged after a Pull Request (PR) is approved. This branch should always have a working functionality.
* **`MPMP-[N]-feature-name`**: Branches for developing individual features or tasks. `[N]` is replaced by the ticket number, and `feature-name` is a brief description of the functionality. For example, for task number 1 related to Gradle configuration, the branch would be named `MPMP-1-gradle-configuration`.

#### Commits

* **`MPMP-[N]: [commit-gist] (#[N])`**: The format for commit messages, where `[N]` is the ticket number, and `[commit-gist]` is a brief description of the changes. For example, for a commit related to Gradle configuration in task number 1, the message would look like this: `MPMP-1: Configured gradle (#1)`.

#### Pull Requests (PR)

* For all PRs on GitHub, it is necessary to use `squash commit` to combine all commits into one before merging into the main branch. This helps keep the change history clean and organized.

#### General Recommendations

* Try to make commits atomic, i.e., each commit should contain a logically complete change.
* Before creating a PR, make sure your branch is up to date with the main branch (`master`) and perform a rebase if necessary.
* The PR should clearly describe the changes being made and, if necessary, provide screenshots or other evidence of the functionality.

Following these rules will help maintain order in the repository and facilitate collaborative work on the project.

### Onboarding

#### Figma: [Onboarding screens](https://www.figma.com/file/iI2ctMyZwWFNMbFcYsbk9q/Mindplex?type=design\&node-id=0-460\&mode=design\&t=27bRTu2XvkRIwMDj-4)

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<mark style="color:green;">**AC1:**</mark> Shown to the user only once, provided that they have viewed all three screens or pressed `Skip`

<mark style="color:green;">**AC2:**</mark> `Skip`redirects the user to the home screen.

<mark style="color:green;">**AC3:**</mark> `Next` redirects the user to the following onboarding screen.

<mark style="color:green;">**AC4:**</mark> A dot indicator should be implemented to show the user which of the three screens they are currently on.

<mark style="color:green;">**AC5:**</mark> User-friendly animation transitions between screens should be implemented.

<mark style="color:green;">**AC6:**</mark> Swipe left-to-right with corresponding onboarding page switching should be implemented.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**OAC7**</mark>**:** Animation with sequential fadeIn appearance of elements should be implemented: first the image, then the title text, description text, dots indicator, and finally the buttons should appear.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**OAC8**</mark>**:** When switching between screens 2 and 3, an animation of the buttons' state change should be implemented.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**OAC9**</mark>**:** When swiping left-to-right, images should be animated with a scale animation.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**OAC10**</mark>**:** Images are animated in Lottie files and have custom motion animations.
