## üìÅ Development Conventions

#### Branching

* **`master`**: The main branch where all changes are merged after a Pull Request (PR) is approved. This branch should
  always have a working functionality.
* **`MPMP-[N]-feature-name`**: Branches for developing individual features or tasks. `[N]` is replaced by the ticket
  number, and `feature-name` is a brief description of the functionality. For example, for task number 1 related to
  Gradle configuration, the branch would be named `MPMP-1-gradle-configuration`.

#### Commits

* **`MPMP-[N]: [commit-gist] (#[N])`**: The format for commit messages, where `[N]` is the ticket number,
  and `[commit-gist]` is a brief description of the changes. For example, for a commit related to Gradle configuration
  in task number 1, the message would look like this: `MPMP-1: Configured gradle (#1)`.

#### Pull Requests (PR)

* For all PRs on GitHub, it is necessary to use `squash commit` to combine all commits into one before merging into the
  main branch. This helps keep the change history clean and organized.

#### General Recommendations

* Try to make commits atomic, i.e., each commit should contain a logically complete change.
* Before creating a PR, make sure your branch is up to date with the main branch (`master`) and perform a rebase if
  necessary.
* The PR should clearly describe the changes being made and, if necessary, provide screenshots or other evidence of the
  functionality.

Following these rules will help maintain order in the repository and facilitate collaborative work on the project.
